 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
📌 Description:
This project explores the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns related to passenger demographics and survival outcomes.

Completed as part of a data science internship task, it demonstrates skills in data cleaning, handling missing values, and data visualization using Python.

🔧 Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Tasks Performed:
Loaded and merged multiple Titanic dataset files

Cleaned missing values and removed unnecessary columns

Encoded categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked)

Visualized survival distribution, age trends, and correlations

Created heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots to analyze data

🎯 Objective:
To practice and apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques using a real-world dataset, and draw insights from it without applying machine learning.
